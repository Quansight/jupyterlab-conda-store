# conda-store

This repository is for the conda-store jupyterlab extension. This extension will serve as the
frontend for the backend conda-store installed binary.

## Developing
Activate the conda environment:
`conda env update -f environment.yaml`

Which will install an isolated version of jupyterlab and a couple other
dependencies.

`pip install . -e`
